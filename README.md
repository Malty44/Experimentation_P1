# Experiment to determine which algorithm is faster based on certain criteria

## All the code and documentation can be found and reused in this repo.

This repository contains all the code needed to recreate the experiment over and over again. The experiment is all about the performance of the algorithms taking into account the execution time of each and everyone of them ( in ms ).
All the necessary files and algorithms are structured logically in their respective folders to promote ease of understanding and readability.

The key parts of this algorithm are :

* The sorting algorithms ( BubbleSort <while> / no <while> needed  | Quicksort / SelectionSort ).
